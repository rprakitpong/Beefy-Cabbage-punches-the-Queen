## Beefy Cabbage punches the Queen
A automata side project from a reddit meme from r/me_irl

# !!!DISCLAIMER!!!
## This project is a joke. I mean no harm to any subject involed in this automata. 
## Please do not take this to mean anything other than a toy.
## Don't spread hate. It's all love up in here.

## 4 main steps:

### 1. Mechanical design in Solidworks:
- The cabbage's arm punches the Queen, so it needs rotation from gears and shaft
- The Queen's head bounces up when punched, so it needs a cam rotated by gears
- The two motion needs to be in sync, so two spur gears connect them
- All key dimensions abstracted into equations.txt config file (Pragmatic Programmer yeeeeee)

### 2. Get vector files of Queen, muscular arm, and cabbage from Paint.net:
- I would've used Illustrator for this if I could get it legally
- Rescale images to appropriate size according to Solidworks models
- You can extrude images into solids in Blender but you need to make a vector outline first

### 3. Assembly in Blender:
- Extrude the 3 images into flat solids and place them according to shaft and cam positions
- Adjust any models from Solidworks to fit the new stuff
- Make sure everything is assembleable in real life
- Export the files appropriately

### 4. 3D Print the files and play with it:
- 3D print the stls
- 2D print the corresponding images of the Queen, muscular arm, and cabbage
- Glue images to flat solids and assemble all parts
